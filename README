This project is a collection of useful java tools and code that I decided to share. 

This is VERY MUCH a work in progress as I collect those from my existing projects.

FairytellerSwing: convenience classes for Swing GUI application
FairytellerUtilities: tools that I commonly use for work and for other things.

Use at your own discretion, I don't mind.
